            <p>
                I've tried and failed to start a blog so many times.
            </p>

            <p>
                Sometimes, usually after I read a great essay on the
                web, I feel that I could. I could write great essays
                about great topics. Topics that I'm interested about,
                like abstraction, or symmetry. Or I could write about
                my hobby of annoying people by continuously asking
                `why`.
            </p>

            <p>
                But I procrastinate. From the first moment that I
                begin my procrastination, I am fully aware that I am
                procrastinating. But I do it anyway. After a while, I
                lose the motivation to write, and I stop before I see
                it through.
            </p>

            <p>
                This made me question myself. Why do I procrastinate?
                The very attempt at writing this entry was preceded by
                something more important. This paragraph is a result
                of several instances of procrastination, spanning at
                least a few weeks.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you're always procrastinating, usually one after
                another, is it correct to imagine them as different
                instances?
            </p>

            <p>
                Lately I've been trying to ask why a lot. I have a
                theory that asking why usually leads to the root of
                something. A nice side-effect is that it makes it
                possible to see, sometimes, the depth of what the
                other person said.
            </p>

            <p>
                But it is a destructive process. It has the potential
                to destroy relationships. So I am trying to do it in
                moderation. But it is tempting, and really easy to get
                carried away, and go too far sometimes, and lose
                perspective.
            </p>

            <p>
                I wanted to write more but I feel like I'm starting to
                procrastinate again. I should probably procrastinate
                procrastination. That would be useful.
